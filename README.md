# CS0447.P1

This program is similar to Adventure for the Atari 2600, it is a dungeon-crawling adventure. You must move your purple dotted protagonist across the map. Collect keys to open doors of that same color, avoid the dragon, and reach the treasure. There is also a skeleton key programmed near the dragon that will remove all keys from the map and allow any door to be opened
